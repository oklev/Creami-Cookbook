#### Comments

From https://www.foodbanjo.com/ninja-creami-pistachio-ice-cream/

Trying a lower calorie version: Seeing if heavy whipping cream + sugar can be adequately replaced with [[Sugar Free French Vanilla Creamer]]. Seems like a long shot, but it cuts out about 600 calories...

This version can probably be mixed on lite ice cream bc it's lower in fat

It's pretty good, but tastes a bit of creamer and it's not as creamy as it should be. Going to try upping the pudding and going down in creamer a bit.

This edition not too different but tastes marginally less of creamer. I think I'll stick with this creamer content, go back down to 2 tbsp pudding, try some xantham gum?
