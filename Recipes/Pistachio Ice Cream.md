From https://www.foodbanjo.com/ninja-creami-pistachio-ice-cream/

Testing both: 1/4 cup [[2% Cottage Cheese]] vs 1/4 tsp [[Xantham Gum]]

Xantham gum: I think it needs a bit more, maybe try 1/2 tsp?

2% cottage cheese was pretty creamy but too much ice crystals. going to try 1) spin on gelato instead of lite ice cream; 2) add in creamer during respin instead of before freezing 

It was also a little low on pistachio flavor so might go back to 3 tbsp pudding when adding cottage cheese (or maybe next time use them to replace some of the milk??)

I ended up not putting in the vanilla creamer. Was an improvement but it's still missing something. A little body maybe? Maybe needs a source of protein like the other recipes to bind everything together? Trying +2 tbsp PB2 almond butter powder.

This did the trick in terms of flavor / texture! But I'd like to lower the calories some if possible.

Too much xantham gum? Better with cottage cheese. Blended not so good
