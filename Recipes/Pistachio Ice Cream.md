#### Comments

From https://www.foodbanjo.com/ninja-creami-pistachio-ice-cream/

Trying a lower calorie version: Seeing if heavy whipping cream + sugar can be adequately replaced with [[Sugar Free French Vanilla Creamer]]. Seems like a long shot, but it cuts out about 600 calories...

This version can probably be mixed on lite ice cream bc it's lower in fat

It's pretty good, but tastes a bit of creamer and it's not as creamy as it should be. Going to try upping the pudding and going down in creamer a bit.

This edition not too different but tastes marginally less of creamer. I think I'll stick with this creamer content, go back down to 2 tbsp pudding, try some xantham gum?

Testing both: 1/4 cup [[2% Cottage Cheese]] vs 1/4 tsp [[Xantham Gum]]

Xantham gum: I think it needs a bit more, maybe try 1/2 tsp?

2% cottage cheese was pretty creamy but too much ice crystals. going to try 1) spin on gelato instead of lite ice cream; 2) add in creamer during respin instead of before freezing 

It was also a little low on pistachio flavor so might go back to 3 tbsp pudding when adding cottage cheese (or maybe next time use them to replace some of the milk??)

I ended up not putting in the vanilla creamer. Was an improvement but it's still missing something. A little body maybe? Maybe needs a source of protein like the other recipes to bind everything together? Trying +2 tbsp PB2 almond butter powder.
