This is a cookbook for the ninja creami that Oliver's working on as a hobby project.

It's meant to be viewed with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) so if the markdown looks a little strange in github, that's why.

The goal is to have lots of very good low calorie ice cream recipes; as well as ways to make them gluten free, dairy free, vegan, etc (eventually).

Recipe sources will be provided where possible.

Keeping the recipes under version control so I can learn more about making them as time goes on I think.
